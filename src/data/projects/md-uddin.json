"description": "An interactive Traffic Light Simulator that models realistic traffic-signal behavior. Users can start and stop the simulation, toggle pedestrian crossings, and adjust timing for green/yellow/red phases. Built with JavaScript, semantic HTML, and responsive CSS, the app demonstrates a deterministic state machine and timer-driven updates with accessible controls for keyboard and screen-reader users.",

"reflections": "Working on this simulator strengthened my frontend fundamentals: implementing a state machine for signal transitions, managing timer-based updates reliably, and structuring code for clarity. I learned to debug race conditions with setInterval/setTimeout, improve accessibility and keyboard support, and prepare the app for deployment on Render. Next steps are adding vehicle/pedestrian animations, saving custom timing presets, and adding unit tests for the timing logic.",
